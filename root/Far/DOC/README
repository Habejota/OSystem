FreeDOS Edit 0.82

Based on DFLAT TUI toolkit as described in Dr. Dobbs Journal (DDJ)
See DFLAT.TXT for more information.

Compiling:
Tested with Borland's Turbo C 2.01 (TC2), Turbo C++ 1.01 (TC++1), 
Turbo C/C++ 3.0 (TC3), and Borland C/C++ 3.1 (TC3/BC3)
Should also work with later versions.

To compile, 1st edit MAKEFILE to match your compiler, followed by
running 'make'.  You may wish to then run clean to remove object
files and lib files, the executables (*.exe) will still be available.
(If compiling with TC3 or earlier? under NT, you may need to ensure
your environment space is not to cluttered, i.e. unset unneeded
environment variables, e.g. 'set PROCESSOR_IDENTIER=', etc. before make.)

Once compiled you may wish to compress with an executable compressor
such as UPX.  If upx.exe is in your path, after make or instead of
'make all' you may run 'make upx' to build and then compress edit.exe


Known Issues:
- The beep() function in console.c produces warnings with TC3 if outp
  macro is defined (you can #undef outp to remove them for TC3, but
  TC++1 does not have an outp function only the macro).
- The keyboard routines block control-break, presently the control-break
  handler is #ifdef'd out as it is unused; reenable if necessary (MESSAGE.C).
- See http://www.freedos.org/bugs/ for additional bugs or to report a bug.
