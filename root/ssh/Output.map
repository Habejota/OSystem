# Select any of following enables. These select some configuration changes

# add-alternate-fi-screenchar will map alternate charsets to finnish national
# 7-bit characters. This will change mapping of äåöÄÅÖ to {}|[]\\.

# enable add-alternate-fi-screenchar

#
# Grammar
# -------
#
# The grammar for this file is following:
#
# CharacterSets charsets-environment-name
#	"charset" = screen-font-environment-name
#	"charset" = screen-font-environment-name
#	....
# end
#
# ScreenChar screen-font-environment-name
#	char = "font:char"
#	char = "char"
#	char = "font::"			# character : using "font"
#	char = "font:with.colon:c"	# character c using "font:with.colon"
#	....
# end
#
# Every name that is used must be defined BEFORE it is used, so
# normally the CharacterSets-struct is at the end etc..
#
#
# Charsets
# --------
#
# Charset can either be one of the predefined charsets (US (default), UK,
# Line, Alt, or AltSpec) or any one character (Character after set charset
# escape sequence (Esc ( x, Esc ) x, etc)).
#
#
# Fonts
# -----
#
# Fonts are system specific font names, like linedraw for linedraw font.
# Font name and character are separated by a colon. There must be exactly one
# character after colon.
#
#
# Chars
# -----
#
# Characters in ScreenChar environment key and value can be any single
# character. You may have to do some quoting to get the all characters.
