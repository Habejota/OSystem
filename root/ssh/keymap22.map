# Select any of following enables. These select some configuration changes
# in keymap file. 

######################################################################
# meta-key-to-eight-bit might not work on every environment, it changes the
# meta key to insert 8-bit version of character instead of normal character.
# Note: In windows you need to map some key to mod5, and you cannot map Alt 
# key to that, because the default windows version don't allow you to map Alt
# to anything (Windows uses it internally, it is enabled only to make AltGr 
# work).
#
# The map-mod5-to-capslock setting will map capslock to be mod5.
#
# enable mod5-key-to-eight-bit
# enable map-mod5-to-capslock

######################################################################
# Scroll-on-key-mapping adds mappings to F1+Control+Shift that will toggle
# the setting of scroll-on-key (does the terminal scroll to bottom of
# history when key is pressed).
#
# enable scroll-on-key-mapping

######################################################################
# Scroll-on-output-mapping adds mappings to F2+Control+Shift that will toggle
# the setting of scroll-on-screen-output (does the terminal scroll to bottom of
# history when something is outputted to screen).
#
# enable scroll-on-output-mapping

######################################################################
# fast-scroll-mapping adds mapping to F3+Control+Shift that will toggle
# the fast-scroll setting (the scrolling is faster, because it will
# scroll several lines at once).
#
# enable fast-scroll-mapping

######################################################################
# fi-7-bit-mapping will add another keymap for Finnish 7-bit versions
# of дец ({}|). The F12+Control+Shift will toggle the keymap between normal
# and fi-7-bit keymap.
#
# enable fi-7-bit-mapping

######################################################################
# pf1-4-keys-in-numpad will map PF1-4 keys to numeric pad to NumLock, /, *,
# and - keys. This emulates standard vt100 key placement.
# Note! NumLock will still act as a Numlock for windows, so the keypad
# will either be in numeric or cursor keys mode.
#
# enable pf1-4-keys-in-numpad

######################################################################
# swap-bs-del-key-mapping adds mapping to BackSpace+Control-Shift and
# Delete+Control-Shift that will toggle both BSIsDel and DelIsBS settings.
# It also adds BackSpace+Control+Shift mapping that will toggle only BSIsDel
# setting and Delete+Control+Shift mapping that will toggle only DelIsBS
# setting. Note! The default Vtkeys mapping is Backspace+Shift = del,
# Delete+Shift = bs.
#
# enable swap-bs-del-key-mapping

######################################################################
# map-control-to-capslock will map Capslock key so it will be control
# key instead of capslock.

# enable map-control-to-capslock
 
#
# Grammar
# -------
#
# The grammar for this file is following:
#
# Keymap keymap-struct-name
#	modifiers = modifiers-enviroment-name
#	keys = keys-environment-name
#	chars = chars-environment-name
#	vtkeys = vtkeys-environment-name
# end
#
# Modifiers modifiers-environment-name
#	key = Shift
#	key = Control
#	key = Mod1 | Alt | Meta
# 	key = Lock | CapsLock
#	key = ShiftLock
#	key = NumLock
#	key = Mod2 | AltGr | Super
#	key = Mod3 | Hyper
#	key = Mod4
#	key = Mod5
#	....
# end
#
# Keys keys-environment-name
#	key+modifierstatus = "action"
#	key+modifierstatus = "action"
#	....
# end
#
# Chars chars-environment-name
#	char = "chars"
#	char = "chars"
#	....
# end
#
# Vtkeys vtkeys-environment-name
#	TH_Name+vtmodifierstatus+vtstatus = "chars"
#	TH_Name+vtmodifierstatus+vtstatus = "chars"
#	....
# end
#
# Every name that is used must be defined BEFORE it is used, so
# normally the Keymap-struct is at the end etc..
#
#
# Modifers
# --------
#
# Modifiers-struct contains mappings from key to one modifier. There
# can be several keys mapping to same modifier and the processing of
# that key is finished after that (it is an error to have any other
# mapping for the key after defining it as a modifier (or combination of
# modifiers)).
#
#
# Keycodes / Keysyms / Keys
# -------------------------
#
# Key is one of the following:
#
#	Keycode_xxx	XXX = is the machine dependad numeric keycode
#			for the key. If you use this remember to
#			add it inside "if enabled xxx ... end".
#
#	keysym		keysym of the key, the keysym is one used in the
#			native system with default prefix removed (in
#			windows virtual keysyms without VK_ prefix, in X11
#			X11 Keysyms, without XK_ prefix etc). Keysyms are
#			case insencetive. All keysyms that are unknown are
#			silenty ignored.
#
#	Anykey		special key that matches any key if none of the
#			previous one matched. Note you can still have
#			modifiers match. 
#
#
# Modifiers-status
# ----------------
#
# In the Keys-environment the shift status is added to key. This status is
# combination of +shiftkey and -shiftkey entries added to key. The +shiftkey
# means that the shiftkey must be on and -shiftkey means that the shift must
# be off before that line matches. If some shiftkeys isn't mentioned in the
# line it's value doesn't care.
#
# So the key "Left+Shift-Control" matches in the Keys-environment if the
# Shift is down and Control is up when the cursor left key is pressed.
#
#
# Actions
# -------
#
# Actions is a whitespace separated string of actions. Each action is
# a function taking some arguments (separated with in parenthes). 
#
# Valid actions are:
#
# special-key(TH_Name)			Send special-vtkey keypress to
#					emulator. This will jump directly

# Chars-environment
# -----------------
#
# This table can be used to convert any char to string of chars. In macintosh
# this table is used to convert from 8-bit mac charset to iso-latin1 charset.
# Note that this is the only table that permits you to overwrite existing
# entries in the table. In all other tables it is an error to have two
# identical key-values, but here it is allowed. 
#
#
# vtkeys-environment
# ------------------
#
# This table is used to convert emulator special keys to string of characters
# sent to remote host. The TH_Name is the name if the emualator special

#
# Vt modifier status
# ------------------
#
# Vt modifier status is combination of the 'Shift', 'Meta', 'Control'. 
#
#
# Vt status
# --------
#
# Vt status is one of the following 'Crlf', 'Cursor', 'Keypad',
# 'Vt52', 'Vt52app'. The order of entries is significant so that None must
# come first and other modifications for the same TH_Key must come after
# that.
#
# Crlf = autolinefeed mode on
# Cursor = cursor keys in application mode
# Keypad = keypad in application mode
# vt52 = in vt52 mode
# vt52app = in vt52 application mode.
#
#
# chars
# -----
#
# Chars is string of charcters in quotes. It can have normal c-style backslash
# escapes.
