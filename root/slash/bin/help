\033[1;0mThis command allows you to open your local files. This command will 
open your documents using the Windows default association for your document 
type.
\033[1;35mopen http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/versions.php
open MyDocuments/MyWork.pdf\033[1;0m

the Dos path from a given Unix path and vice-versa. You can also list your 
computer paths like the Windows, System, Desktop, Profiles and Start Menu 
paths.
\033[1;35mecho \"/bin PATH = \$(cygpath -w /bin)\"
echo \"System PATH = \$(cygpath -u -S)\"
\033[1;0m

\033[1;32m- The /drives mount path
\033[1;0mThis directory contains a mount point for each drive of your computer. 
You can for example browse your system drive by cd to /drives/c/
\033[1;35mcat /drives/c/Windows/win.ini
PicView /drives/d/MyPhotos/Photo36.jpg
\033[1;0m

\033[1;32m- The /registry virtual folder
\033[1;0mThis folder is a virtual directory containing your registry keys and 
values. You can open and read a registry key by doing a simple \"cat\" of these 
virtual files.
\033[1;35mcat /registry/HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Environment/TEMP
\033[1;0m

\033[1;32m- The // mount point
\033[1;0mYou can also browse computers from your network neighborhood by typing

\033[1;36m1.b. Network utilities
\033[1;0m

\033[1;32m- Remote computing
\033[1;0mMobaXterm includes some useful clients for executing commands on 
remote computers:
. ssh (utility to access shell accounts using a secure crypted connection)
. telnet (useful to login to remote system hosts)
. rlogin (same aim as telnet but using a different protocol)
. rsh (useful for sending commands on remote computers, especially using the 
passwordless feature)
Do not forget that you can bookmark your connections using the bookmarks 
feature (see the corresponding section for more information). You can also set 
up passwordless connections with rsh or ssh, there is also a corresponding 
section to this feature.


\033[1;32m- DISPLAY settings
\033[1;0mMobaXterm includes an X server so that it can display X11-based 
graphical programs.
By default, an X server is started at MobaXterm startup. Your DISPLAY 
environment variable is automatically set and it is written in your terminal 
startup message. When you use a remote computing client to connect to a Unix 
computer, you can export your DISPLAY to your local Windows desktop thanks to 
MobaXterm. When you use a SSH connection, if the remote server supports X11-
Forwarding, your DISPLAY is automatically set and it will be sent through the 
SSH connection to your Windows desktop.
Note: if you have troubles with some kind of interfaces (Motif-based programs 
for example), you can also run a full window manager by clicking on the 
corresponding button in the top toolbar.
\033[1;35mtelnet remoteserver1
export DISPLAY=localcomputer1:0.0 
nedit
exit
ssh -l root remoteserver1
nedit
\033[1;0m

\033[1;32m- File transfer
\033[1;0mMobaXterm includes some useful clients for transferring files
. ftp (File Transfert Protocol)
. sftp/scp (File Transfert using a secure crypted SSH connection)
. rcp (Copy files to/from remote computers using the rsh protocol)
. wget (download files through http/ftp protocol with enhanced settings)
. rsync (synchronize directories through a network with incremental 
capabilities and enhanced options)
\033[1;35mscp /drives/c/Photo36.jpg root@server1:/tmp/
\033[1;0m

\033[1;32m- Xdmcp session
\033[1;0mMobaXterm includes XDMCP capabilities for opening a remote desktop in 
a Windows frame. This protocol allows you to show the full remote desktop just 
like an old Terminal X. All you have to do is clicking on the corresponding 
button in the top toolbar.


\033[1;32m- Network monitoring
\033[1;0mMobaXterm includes 2 useful utilities for monitoring your network:
. TCPCapture (allows you to capture network packets)

\033[1;0m

\033[1;32m- Tab interface
\033[1;0mMobaXterm can start several independent terminals thanks to a tab-
based interface.
Use the appropriate button to create new tabs, close existing tabs, cycling 
through tabs or rename tabs.


\033[1;32m- Split modes
\033[1;0mMobaXterm allows you to display some terminals in the same Window just 
as you would do using the \"screen\" utility.
You can display 2 terminals in horizontal or vertical mode, or even 4 terminals 
in the same Window


\033[1;32m- Save/Print features
\033[1;0mMobaXterm allows you to save your terminal output to a file, or to 
print it using the appropriate buttons from the top toolbar.

\033[1;0mYou can edit your options using the corresponding button from the top 
toolbar. Your options will be saved to an INI file. You can select a persistent 
home directory for keeping your files and parameters instead of having your 
home directory in a temporary folder. You can also select the terminal fonts, 
colors, skin, etc...


\033[1;32m- Bookmarks
\033[1;0mYou can store your connection settings in bookmarks that are stored in 
your INI file. Bookmarks can be accessed easily through the corresponding menu 
in the top toolbar, but you can also create a desktop shortcut of each bookmark 
in order to launch them easily.





\033[1;36m1.d. Other utilities
\033[1;0m

\033[1;32m- Editors

\033[1;31m2. \033[4mHow to\033[1;0m


\033[1;36m2.a. Set up a passwordless ssh connection
\033[1;0m

You can connect to an SSH server without supplying any password: this is useful 
if you want to run shell scripts that are not interactive. This can be done in 
2 steps:

\033[1;32m- On client side
\033[1;0mYou will have to generate a public rsa key on the client. This can be 
done by typing
\033[1;35mssh-keygen -t rsa 
\033[1;0m

\033[1;32m- On server side
\033[1;0mCopy the file that has been generated on the client
(\".ssh/id_rsa.pub\") to the ~/.ssh/ directory of the server and rename it to
\"authorized_keys\".
\033[1;35mscp .ssh/id_rsa.pub user1@server1:.ssh/authorized_keys
\033[1;0m




\033[1;36m2.b. Set up a passwordless rsh connection
\033[1;0m

You can connect to an RSH server without supplying any password: this is useful 
if you want to run shell scripts that are not interactive. This can be done in 
1 step:

\033[1;32m- Using /etc/hosts.equiv
\033[1;0mEdit the /etc/hosts.equiv file on server side: you can specify in this 
file the authorized users that will be able to connect to the server without 
supplying any password. The file syntax is:
\033[1;35m<computer_name> <user_name> 
\033[1;0m

\033[1;32m- Using ~/.rhosts
\033[1;0mEdit the ~/.rhosts file on server side: you can specify in this file 
the authorized users that will be able to connect to the server using the 
current account without supplying any password. The file syntax is:
\033[1;35m<computer_name> <user_name> 
\033[1;0m




\033[1;36m2.c. Execute a shell script at MobaXterm startup
\033[1;0m

\033[1;32m- Using commandline parameters
\033[1;0mYou can edit a shell script (be careful, it has to be in Unix and not 
Dos format) and run it at MobaXterm startup. You just have to launch MobaXterm 
with the following command line:
\033[1;35mMobaXterm.exe <script_file> 
\033[1;0m

\033[1;32m- Using bookmarks
\033[1;0mCreate a new bookmark, select the \"Custom shell script\" option in 
the dropdown menu and edit your shell script. You can then click on your 
bookmark and choose to create a desktop shortcut to this bookmark.
